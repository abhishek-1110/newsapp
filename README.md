Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

This project has not been deployed because to make NewsAPI work on a domain link we need to purchase its subscription. It works free for localhost only.
